# travel-estimator (unfinished)

Script with use of exteranal API to count cost of traveling by car from one place to another.

Base idea:

- interactive map of Europe;
- pick 2 places with click on map;
- set an average car fuel consumption;
- set the precision (higher precision - longer time to gain results)

- after submit, there are two markers at the places you chose and a trail between them (API);
- also as the results there are origin and destination points, distance driven in each country, average fuel consumption (data from input), fuel used through whole journey and its cost in euro (value of currency fetch with API)
